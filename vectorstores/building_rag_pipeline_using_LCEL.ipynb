       "'The Amritapuri campus is located in Vallikavu, a serene coastal village in the state of Kerala, India. The location is described in the materials as “Located in Vallikavu, Kerala, spanning 80 acres along the coastline,” which places the campus directly on the coastal belt of the region. In other words, the campus sits beside the sea within the rural and tranquil setting of Vallikavu, a village noted for its coastal character and peaceful surroundings.\\n\\nKey aspects of the location that define the campus’s sense of place are as follows:\\n\\n- Geographic setting: The campus is situated in Vallikavu, a village on the Kerala coast. The wording emphasizes that it lies along the coastline, indicating direct proximity to the sea and exposure to coastal scenery. This coastal placement is a defining feature of the campus location, contributing to the campus atmosphere and environment.\\n\\n- Physical extent: The campus covers 80 acres of land. This sizeable area indicates a substantial, spread-out campus rather than a compact, urban campus. The large footprint supports a diverse campus ecosystem, including academic facilities, residential space, and research infrastructure, all embedded within a single coastal setting.\\n\\n- Built environment: The Amritapuri campus has over one million square feet of built-up area. This figure signals a dense and extensive built environment within the 80-acre site, reflecting a substantial concentration of classrooms, laboratories, administrative buildings, housing, and other facilities, all arranged to fit within the coastal landscape of Vallikavu.\\n\\n- Campus composition and use: The site houses six prestigious schools and more than 20 specialized research centers. This mix of schools and research facilities indicates that the location is a multi-disciplinary academic hub within Vallikavu, designed to accommodate a broad spectrum of disciplines in close proximity to one another on the same campus grounds.\\n\\n- Residential character: The campus is described as highly residential, with approximately 95 percent of students living in hostels, many of which are located within the ashram premises. This aspect of the location highlights a self-contained community where living spaces are integrated with the academic and spiritual environment. The residential nature reinforces the sense that the campus is a self-sustaining micro-community situated in Vallikavu’s coastal landscape.\\n\\n- Spiritual-educational blend: The location is characterized by a blend of modern science and spiritual values. While this speaks to the campus’s ethos rather than a strictly geographic attribute, it is a defining feature of how the campus sits in its physical space and how students experience the location daily. The coastal setting in Vallikavu is presented as part of the overall environment that supports this unique fusion of disciplines and perspectives.\\n\\n- Surrounding facilities and capacity: With over 20 specialized research centers and facilities such as HuT Labs (Humanitarian Technology Labs) and other advanced laboratories, the campus location supports a research-intensive environment. The coastal campus arrangement allows these facilities to occupy distinct zones within the 80-acre site, contributing to a sense of breadth and diversity in the location itself.\\n\\n- Community and accessibility context: The location within a serene coastal village suggests a tranquil, less urbanized surroundings that contrast with more crowded urban campuses. Being in Vallikavu places the Amritapuri campus in a locale that is described as serene and coastal, which can influence factors such as campus life, pace of daily routines, and the way students perceive and experience the location during their studies.\\n\\nIn summary, the location of the Amritapuri campus is defined by its setting in Vallikavu, Kerala, along the coastline. It occupies 80 acres of coastal land and contains over one million square feet of built-up space, organized to accommodate six schools and more than 20 research centers. The campus is distinctly residential, with the majority of students living in on-campus hostels, many of which lie within the ashram premises. This combination of a large, coastal, self-contained site with a multi-disciplinary academic and research ecosystem creates a unique location that blends modern science with spiritual values, all situated in the serene coastal environment of Vallikavu. If you are seeking the precise geographic placement, the official description provides Vallikavu, Kerala as the location, explicitly tied to the coastal landscape and the extensive campus footprint described above.'"
