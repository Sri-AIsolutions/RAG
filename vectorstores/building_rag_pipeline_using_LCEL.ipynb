The campus sits on an 80-acre site that runs along the coastline, offering a seaside setting as its physical backdrop.\\n\\nGeographic setting and scale\\n- Location: Vallikavu, Kerala, India.\\n- Physical footprint: 80 acres of land that coastline-side, giving the campus a broad, expansive feel in a rural, coastal environment.\\n- Landscape and surroundings: The campus is described as being along the coast, which implies access to sea views and a maritime ambience that frames daily life on campus.\\n\\nCampus footprint and built environment\\n- Built-up area: The campus comprises over one million square feet of built-up space. This substantial built environment supports a large, multi-institutional campus within a single location.\\n- Institutional layout: The Amritapuri Campus houses six prestigious schools and more than 20 specialized research centers, all within the Vallikavu site. The extensive built environment supports a diverse array of programs and scholarly activity under one campus umbrella.\\n- Residential character: The campus is highly residential, with approximately 95 percent of students living in hostels. Many of these hostels are located within the ashram premises, reinforcing a living-learning environment where study, community, and spiritual values are integrated on a daily basis.\\n\\nStructure and academic focus in relation to location\\n- Schools and research: The campus’s physical layout is designed to support six schools and a network of more than 20 research centers. This implies a campus where departments and research facilities are clustered to create synergies in areas such as biotechnology, Ayurveda, engineering, computing, and social sciences.\\n- Academic programs tied to the environment: The Amritapuri Campus is noted for blending science with spirituality, reflecting its coastal, serene setting as part of its identity. Programs highlighted in the available context include Computing, Engineering, Biotechnology, Ayurveda, and related social sciences. While the exact program mix is described with some variation in the text, the location supports a broad, interdisciplinary blend that leverages the campus’s sizable facilities and research infrastructure.\\n\\nKey facilities and research relevance tied to the location\\n- HuT Labs and research focus: The campus hosts Humanitarian Technology (HuT) Labs, underscoring its role as a research powerhouse situated in Vallikavu.

These activities reflect how the campus’s coastal location supports a practical, forward-looking research ecosystem.\\n- Campus facilities for students: The campus provides high-speed computer labs with more than 600 systems and extensive sports complexes for cricket and football. While these are general facilities, their scale is consistent with a large, coastal campus environment designed to accommodate a substantial student population living in hostels.\\n\\nLocal environment and campus culture tied to location\\n- Serene coastal setting: Descriptions repeatedly emphasize the “serene coastal village” of Vallikavu, suggesting a campus culture influenced by its proximity to the sea and its tranquil surroundings. This environment supports both rigorous academic work and contemplative or spiritual values, which the campus explicitly aims to blend with modern science.\\n- Religious and residential context: The reference to many hostels being located within ashram premises points to a living-learning environment where students reside close to campus facilities and the spiritual dimensions that the campus highlights as part of its identity.\\n\\nSummary of location-related details\\n- The Amritapuri Campus is located in Vallikavu, Kerala, on an 80-acre coastal site.\\n- It features a vast built-up area (over one million square feet) and houses six schools and more than 20 research centers within the same campus footprint.\\n- The campus is highly residential (about 95% of students live in hostels), with many accommodations located within the ashram premises.\\n- Its coastal setting underpins a unique blend of modern science and spirituality, reflected in its programs and research initiatives.\\n- Notable facilities and activities tied to the location include the Humanitarian Technology (HuT) Labs, the PRABHA IOT robot project, and hosting the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics.\\n- Academic programs mentioned in connection with the location include Computing, Engineering, Biotechnology, Ayurveda, and Social Sciences, illustrating the campus’s diverse, interdisciplinary environment in a coastal, serene setting.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for the precise address, map coordinates, or nearby landmarks beyond Vallikavu, Kerala, those specifics aren’t provided in the context you shared.
