       "'The location of the Amritapuri Campus, as described in the provided context, is Vallikavu, a serene coastal village in the Indian state of Kerala. The campus is situated along the coastline, giving it a distinctive seaside setting that combines natural beauty with an academic environment. In terms of size, the Amritapuri Campus spans about 80 acres, which translates into a substantial footprint on the coastside where education and spiritual values are integrated.\\n\\nKey geographic and contextual details about the location include:\\n- City and state: Vallikavu village, Kerala, India.\\n- Setting: Coastal, with the campus positioned along the shoreline. The coastal location is repeatedly emphasized, underscoring its importance to the campus identity.\\n- Campus size: Approximately 80 acres of land, indicating a large, semi-rural campus with room for extensive facilities.\\n- Built environment: The campus has more than one million square feet of built-up area, reflecting a substantial physical infrastructure to support its academic programs and research activities.\\n- Community and landscape: The description highlights a serene environment typical of a coastal village in Kerala, suggesting a calm, inviting campus atmosphere that blends modern education with a spiritual orientation.\\n\\nWithin this location, the Amritapuri Campus is described as a unique blend of modern science and spiritual values. This positioning is not only about the academic programs but also about the physical and cultural setting that the location fosters. The coastal setting contributes to the campus’s ambiance, offering a backdrop that supports both rigorous scientific work and reflective, value-based learning. The fact that the campus sits in a rural coastal village rather than in a dense urban center reinforces its distinctive character and the experiential opportunities it provides to students and researchers.\\n\\nThe campus layout and facilities, as described in the context, further illuminate how the location supports its mission:\\n- Academic and research facilities: The campus houses six prestigious schools and more than 20 specialized research centers. While these details describe the campus’s intellectual footprint, they are contingent on the large 80-acre site, which provides the space necessary for a multi-institutional academic ecosystem to operate within the same geographic area.\\n- Residential nature: The Amritapuri Campus is described as highly residential, with about 95 percent of students living in hostels. Many of these hostels are located within the ashram premises, illustrating how the location supports a close-knit, campus-life-centric environment. The proximity of student housing to academic and research facilities is a practical outcome of the campus’s coastal, village setting and sizable land area.\\n- Campus identity: The combination of “modern science and spiritual values” is both a curricular identity and a reflection of the location’s cultural milieu. Although not a geographic attribute alone, this identity is reinforced by the environment in which the campus sits—Vallikavu’s coastal surroundings and Kerala’s broader heritage of spirituality and learning.\\n\\nIn sum, the location of the Amritapuri Campus can be characterized as follows:\\n- It is physically located in Vallikavu, Kerala, on the coast.\\n- It occupies a sizable 80-acre site along the coastline, providing ample space for a large built environment and extensive facilities.\\n- The campus’s built-up area exceeds one million square feet, indicating substantial infrastructure within a coastal setting.\\n- The location supports a residential campus life, with the majority of students housed in hostels, many within the ashram precincts, fostering a cohesive, campus-centered community.\\n- The coastal location complements the campus’s mission to blend science with spiritual values, situating academic pursuits within a serene, natural environment that is conducive to both rigorous research and reflective learning.\\n\\nIf you are seeking a precise description of “where” the Amritapuri Campus sits within Vallikavu, Kerala, the essential takeaway is that it lies along the coastline in the serene village of Vallikavu, occupying about 80 acres and featuring a large, integrated campus with multiple schools, research centers, and residential facilities. The emphasis on coastline and village setting is a defining element of its location, shaping the daily life, atmosphere, and educational experience of students, faculty, and researchers who operate there.'"
