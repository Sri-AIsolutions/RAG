   Sri is a passionate and highly motivated learner who is actively transitioning into the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. 
   With a strong curiosity about how intelligent systems function, Sri is focused on building 
   solid practical foundations in AI, including Python programming, data structures, model training, and deployment workflows. Instead of limiting learning to theory, Sri
     strongly prefers a hands-on, project-based approach, using tools such as Google Colab, Python libraries, and real-world datasets to gain deeper understanding. 
     This approach helps translate abstract concepts into real implementations, especially in areas like regression, classification, and neural networks.
