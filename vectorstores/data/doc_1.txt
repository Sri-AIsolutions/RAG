Sri has a growing interest in AI-driven healthcare solutions, particularly in cancer detection using MRI and medical imaging.
 This interest has led to working on literature surveys, studying CNN architectures, and exploring how image processing techniques can support early and accurate diagnosis. 
 At the same time, Sri is actively learning about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, vector databases, embeddings, and modern AI frameworks like LangChain. 
 A key focus is understanding how documents are split, embedded, stored, and retrieved, enabling intelligent systems to reason over custom knowledge bases rather 
 than relying solely on pretrained model knowledge.
